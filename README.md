# Python.Swarms
Swarm simulation

Framework to create differnt swarms by writing classes of swarm behaviour strategies.

The strategy can either result from the behaviour of the single figures (like ants, bees or robots) 
or be fully supervised on the game level like in chess or be a combination of both like in economy, society or war.

The program uses python and curses. It will run on most Unix (Linux, Mac) but not directly on Windows.
